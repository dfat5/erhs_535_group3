#Association between dependent and independent variables:
Create summaries and visualizations of how the dependent variable is
associated with different independent variables. Here, we will try to
discover if there are characteristics of the drugs that are associated
with effectiveness against TB. This group will need to come up with
ways (and code) to analyze that in the data. This might include
generalized linear models, scatterplots, and possibly other supervised
learning methods.

#Pull in Data
```{r}
efficacy_summary <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KatieKey/input_output_shiny_group/master/CSV_Files/efficacy_summary.csv")
head(efficacy_summary)

clean_2_combined <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KatieKey/input_output_shiny_group/master/CSV_Files/clean_2_combined.csv")
head(clean_2_combined)
```



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
